# Summit.OS AI Architecture

## Overview

Summit.OS is the distributed intelligence fabric that serves as the **sense-making and autonomy brain** for all BigMT robotics systems. AI is not an add-on feature—it's the connective tissue that enables every robot, drone, and sensor to understand, decide, and act in the physical world.

## 🧠 AI Integration by Layer

### 1. Data Fusion & Sensemaking (Perception Layer)

**Purpose**: Convert raw sensor streams into a unified world model  
**Analogous to**: LatticeOS "sensor fusion + environment model"

#### AI Capabilities:
- **Multimodal Sensor Fusion**: Weather, LiDAR, IR, visual data → spatial context
- **Anomaly Detection**: Smoke, leaks, flooding, temperature spikes
- **Terrain & Object Segmentation**: Brush vs. road vs. water from drone imagery
- **Environmental State Estimation**: Dryness, wind vectors, fire spread rate, blockage probability

#### Cross-Domain Applications:
- **Wildfires** → smoke/fire ignition probability
- **Agriculture** → erosion/obstruction in ditches  
- **Oilfields** → leak or pressure anomaly detection
- **Sanitation** → fill level or gas emission detection
- **Disaster** → debris mapping and victim localization

### 2. Object Detection, Classification & Tracking

**Purpose**: Know what's out there and how it's moving  
**Analogous to**: LatticeOS object tracking and threat detection

#### AI Capabilities:
- **Computer Vision Models** (ONNX/TensorRT): Detect smoke, tools, humans, vehicles, pipes, waste bins
- **Multisensor Tracking**: Maintain persistent IDs across video frames and sensor types
- **State Recognition**: "valve open," "fireline constructed," "ditch cleared"
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Predict object motion or environmental changes

#### Cross-Domain Applications:

- **Farm DitchBot**: Track water flow, debris motion
- **Oilfield**: Track hose coupling alignment, valve positions
- **GreaseBot**: Track clog progression, fluid dynamics

### 3. Autonomous Operations & Decision Reasoning (Task Layer)

**Purpose**: Decide what to do next given goals and constraints  
**Analogous to**: LatticeOS "autonomous command & control"

#### AI Capabilities:
- **Mission Planning**: Graph-based planners + reinforcement learning for optimal task assignment
- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Decide which asset performs which subtask
- **Predictive Modeling**: Physics + ML hybrid models forecasting outcomes
- **Contextual Advisory**: Generate human-readable summaries for ops consoles

#### Cross-Domain Applications:
- **FireLine** → fire spread prediction + suppression tasking
- **Farm DitchBot** → route optimization for culvert clearing
- **Oilfield** → valve sequence automation
- **GreaseBot** → dynamic route scheduling
- **Triage** → resource allocation, victim prioritization

### 4. Learning & Continuous Improvement (Data Backbone)

**Purpose**: Make the system smarter over time

#### AI Capabilities:
- **Model Retraining Pipelines**: New sensor data improves detection accuracy
- **Edge-to-Cloud Federated Learning**: Local models train on field data, sync gradients
- **Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real)**: Reinforcement learning environments for robotics tasks
- **Anomaly Feedback Loops**: Operator confirmations fine-tune detection thresholds
