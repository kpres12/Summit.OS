# Heli.OS AI Architecture

## Overview

Heli.OS is the distributed intelligence fabric that serves as the **sense-making and autonomy brain** for all Heli.OS robotics systems. AI is not an add-on feature—it's the connective tissue that enables every robot, drone, and sensor to understand, decide, and act in the physical world.
