# Summit.OS Implementation Status

This document tracks the progress of implementing the suggested next steps for Summit.OS.

## Completed ✅

### 1. mTLS Infrastructure (✅ Complete)
**Location**: `infra/proxy/`

**What was built**:
- Comprehensive nginx mTLS proxy configuration for all services (API Gateway, Fabric, Fusion, Intelligence, Tasking)
- Certificate generation script (`generate_certs.sh`) with org_id support via OU field
- Automatic extraction of `org_id` from client certificates and forwarding via `X-Org-ID` header
- Docker Compose profiles for easy enablement (`--profile mtls`)
- Complete documentation in `infra/proxy/README.md`

**How to use**:
```bash
# Generate certificates
cd infra/proxy
./generate_certs.sh

# Start with mTLS enabled
docker-compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml --profile mtls up -d

# Test with client certificate
cd infra/proxy/certs
curl --cacert ca.crt --cert client-org1.crt --key client-org1.key \
  https://localhost:8443/health
```

**Integration points**:
- Backend services should read `X-Org-ID` header for multi-tenancy
- Services exposed on ports: 8443 (API), 8451 (Fabric), 8452 (Fusion), 8453 (Intelligence), 8454 (Tasking)

### 2. Console Map Enhancements (✅ Complete)
**Location**: `apps/console/components/tactical/`

**What was built**:
- **MapLayerControls.tsx**: Interactive layer toggle UI with 7 default layers (terrain, grid, nodes, connections, geofences, tracks, weather)
- **GeofenceEditor.tsx**: Full CRUD UI for geofences with support for exclusion/inclusion/warning zones, altitude ranges, and polygon editing
- Enhanced TacticalMap.tsx with layer-aware rendering and geofence visualization

**Features**:
- Collapsible layer/geofence controls
- Real-time toggle of map layers
- Geofence types: exclusion (red), inclusion (green), warning (amber)
- Altitude min/max constraints per geofence
- Interactive geofence creation (click map to add vertices)
- Visual feedback with Soviet-green CRT aesthetic

**Usage**:
- Access via main tactical map view
- Click "+" to create new geofence
- Toggle layers via "LAYERS" panel
- Edit/delete geofences from list

---

### 3. OIDC Authentication (✅ Complete)
**Location**: `apps/console/lib/auth.ts`, `apps/console/components/AuthProvider.tsx`, `apps/console/app/auth/`, `apps/console/app/login/`

**What was built**:
- Complete OIDC/OAuth2 authentication flow with PKCE
- `lib/auth.ts`: Core auth functions (PKCE generation, token exchange, JWT parsing)
- `AuthProvider.tsx`: React context for managing auth state
- `/auth/callback` page: Handles authorization code exchange
- `/login` page: Styled login UI with system status indicators
- User model with org_id and roles extraction from ID token

**Configuration** (environment variables):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OIDC_ISSUER=https://auth.summit-os.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=summit-console
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
NEXT_PUBLIC_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

**Token claims used**:
- `sub`: User ID
- `email`: Email address
- `name` / `preferred_username`: Display name
- `org_id`: Organization ID (for multi-tenancy)
- `roles` / `realm_access.roles`: User roles

---

### 4. Coverage Pattern Planners (✅ Complete)
**Location**: `apps/tasking/coverage_patterns.py`

**What was built**:
Six mission planning algorithms:
1. **Grid Pattern** (`grid_coverage_pattern`): Lawnmower pattern for systematic area coverage
2. **Spiral Pattern** (`spiral_coverage_pattern`): Archimedean spiral for radial search
3. **Perimeter Patrol** (`perimeter_patrol_pattern`): Follow polygon boundaries with offset
4. **Orbit/Loiter** (`orbit_pattern`): Circular observation pattern
5. **Expanding Search** (`expand_search_pattern`): SAR-style expanding square pattern
6. **Haversine Distance**: Accurate geographic distance calculations

**Data structures**:
- `Waypoint`: Lat/lon/alt with speed, action, and metadata
- `BoundingBox`: Geographic bounds with width/height calculations

**Example usage**:
```python
from coverage_patterns import grid_coverage_pattern, BoundingBox

bbox = BoundingBox(lat_min=34.05, lat_max=34.10, lon_min=-118.30, lon_max=-118.20)
waypoints = grid_coverage_pattern(bbox, altitude=100, spacing_m=50, speed=5.0)

# Convert to API format
plan = [wp.to_dict() for wp in waypoints]
```

## In Progress / Not Yet Started

### 5. Mission Timeline Visualization (⏳ Pending)
**Location**: Should be in `apps/console/components/tactical/`

**What's needed**:
- Timeline component showing mission phases
- Task sequencing and dependencies
- ETA calculations and progress tracking
- Integration with tasking service mission data

**Suggested approach**:
- Create `MissionTimeline.tsx` component
- Show phases: Planning → Dispatch → Active → Completed
- Display assigned assets per phase
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

---

### 6. Server-Side Policy Engine (⏳ Pending)
**Location**: Should be in `apps/api-gateway/` or `infra/policy/`

**What's needed**:
- OPA (Open Policy Agent) integration for policy decisions
- Policy rules for:
  - Geofence violations
  - Altitude restrictions
  - Airspace constraints
  - Weather limits
  - Asset capability matching
- Clear denial reasons/messages

**Suggested approach**:
```python
# In api-gateway or tasking service
from opa_client import OPAClient

opa = OPAClient("http://opa:8181")

def check_mission_policy(mission_request, org_id):
    decision = opa.evaluate(
        policy="missions/approval",
        input={
            "mission": mission_request.dict(),
            "org_id": org_id,
        }
    )
    
    if not decision["result"]["allow"]:
        reasons = decision["result"]["deny_reasons"]
        raise PolicyDeniedError(reasons)
```

Note: OPA service already exists in docker-compose but needs policy files and integration.

---

### 7. Policy Denial UI (⏳ Pending)
**Location**: Should be in `apps/console/components/`

**What's needed**:
- Toast/notification component for policy denials
- Detailed error modal showing:
  - Which policy was violated
  - Why it was violated
  - Suggested corrections
- Integration with error responses from backend

---

### 8. E2E Tests (⏳ Pending)
**Location**: Should be in `tests/e2e/` or `apps/*/tests/e2e/`

**What's needed**:
Test suite covering:
- Smoke detection → Advisory creation
- Advisory approval workflow
- Mission planning and dispatch
- Asset tasking and execution
- Full workflow integration

**Suggested tools**:
- pytest + pytest-asyncio
- httpx for API calls
- docker-compose for test environment
- Mock MQTT messages for edge scenarios

**Example structure**:
```
tests/e2e/
  ├── conftest.py (fixtures, compose startup)
  ├── test_smoke_to_advisory.py
  ├── test_advisory_to_dispatch.py
  ├── test_full_mission_workflow.py
  └── utils/
      ├── api_client.py
      ├── mqtt_publisher.py
      └── assertions.py
```

## Architecture Notes

### Multi-Tenancy Flow
1. Client presents certificate with `OU=org1`
2. Nginx extracts OU → `X-Org-ID: org1` header
3. API Gateway/services read header
4. Database queries filtered by org_id
5. Results returned only for that organization

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "AUTHENTICATE" on /login
2. Redirected to OIDC provider with PKCE challenge
3. User authenticates at provider
4. Redirected to /auth/callback with authorization code
5. Code exchanged for tokens (access_token, id_token)
6. User info extracted from id_token (including org_id)
7. Tokens stored in localStorage
8. User redirected to /

### Mission Planning Flow
1. User defines area on map (via geofence editor or bounding box)
2. Selects coverage pattern (grid, spiral, perimeter, etc.)
3. System generates waypoints using coverage_patterns.py
4. Policy engine validates mission (OPA)
5. Mission created in database
6. Assets assigned based on capabilities
7. Waypoints dispatched to assets via MQTT
8. Timeline updated as mission progresses

---

## Next Steps Priority

**Highest Priority**:
1. Integrate coverage patterns into tasking service APIs
2. Add policy engine integration and OPA rules
3. Create mission timeline visualization

**Medium Priority**:
4. Build E2E test suite
5. Set up CI pipeline
6. Add policy denial UI

**Nice to Have**:
7. Advanced geofence editing (drag vertices, split polygons)
8. Real-time asset tracking on map
9. Mission replay/simulation
10. Performance dashboards
